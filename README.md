#  Xylophone

## Outline

This app makes me learn about how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation. I learn to solve problems by exploring StackOverflow, Apple Documentation and learning how to search for solutions effectively. By learning to use these tools, Iâ€™ll be able to start adding custom features to an app and get it to do what I want it to.

## What is Xylophone
